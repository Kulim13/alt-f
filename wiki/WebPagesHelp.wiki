No developer likes writing documentation,they consider it a waste of their precious coding gift :-)

Some Alt-F web pages have built-in help pages. On those pages, a (?) icon appears next to the web page title, and if you hit the icon, you go to the associated help page.

If you want to contribute to Alt-F you can write the help pages yourself, as they are plain html pages.

If you don't know html, just write the help page in standard text and submit them, I will add the html formatting.

Please don't send html help pages created in MS-Word, Openoffice or whatever, they are *big*. If you want or have to use document editors, save as text and send the text.
