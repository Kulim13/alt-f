#summary How to install packages without internet access.

= Introduction =

In same situations the box has no internet connectivity, for whatever reason, but the user might want to install additional Alt-F disk-installable packages.

== How to do it ==

In those situations, one package can be installed without internet connectivity: just download ipkg_0.99.163_arm.ipk from
[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1555717/DNS-323/Alt-F/pkgs/unstable/ipkg_0.99.163_arm.ipk?dl Dropbox] and drop it in the box /tmp directory.

Alt-F Package Manager installs it, and after that you can setup in the Alt-F Package Manager a local network package feed.
This means that you have to download all packages files, as well as the Package file, from the above site, make them available through a local-network httpd server, and configure that local httpd server directory as the package feed.
