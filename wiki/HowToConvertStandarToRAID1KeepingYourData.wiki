#summary How to convert a "standard" filesystem to RAID1 keeping all your data

{{{

If you have a one disk "standard" filesystem and which to convert it to RAID1,
you can follow one of the following procedures:

A: DON'T follow, a bug was found in (1) bellow
-Create a new degraded RAID1 with your new disk using Disk->Wizard (1)
-Copy all data from the old "standard" partition to the new RAID1 using Setup->Folders
-Verify that the data in the RAID1 is fine
-Change the old disk "standard" partition type to RAID (2) using Disk->Partitioner
-Add the old disk RAID partition to the new RAID as a new component using Disk->RAID

B:
-Shrink your current "standard" filesystem using Disk->Filesystem
-Change the "standard" partition type to RAID (2) using Disk->Partitioner
-Create a degraded RAID1 using the now RAID partition using Disk->RAID
-Enlarge the filesystem contained in the RAID using Disk->Filesystem
-Add a new disk and follow the "How to fix a degraded RAID1 wiki"

NOTES:

(1)-Make sure that the new disk in the only disk checked in the Disk Wizard upper section!
(2)-Make sure to only uncheck the "Keep" check-box for the "standard" partition, and then only change its type from "linux" to "RAID" -- don't change anything else!
