How to install:

1-If you don't have ffp or a fun_plug file in your box root directory, then
	just download "Alt-F-<version>.tar" and "fun_plug" into your box root
	directory, make sure that "fun_plug" has execution permission and reboot.
	This will only work for one reboot; if you want to try again, you must
	set the execution permissions of fun_plug again.
	This is deliberate, you can override it by editing fun_plug and commenting
	the line on top that says ONCE. Without this, if something goes wrong,
	then your box would reboot endlessly!

2-If you have a fun_plug file, but don't have ffp, than save your current
	fun_plug file, and proceed as in 1 above.

3-If you have ffp,
	3-a) Just want to try Alt-F once in a while:
		download Alt-F-<version>.tar and fun_plug, rename run_plug to, e.g,
		alt-f.sh, put them in your box root directory, and call alt-f.sh from
		the shell. Sometimes "reloading" fails complaining with a not enought
		memory error -- and freezes. If this happens, stop first all ffp services.
		Your ffp directory, if found in the root directory, will be recognized
		and used by Alt-F. The ffp init script will be executed at "reload" time,
		but you should disable all non needed ffp init scripts, and only keep
		those that provide services that Alt-F don't have.
		Alt-F binaries have precedence over others.

	3-b) You want to always use it:
		Proceed and in 2), but read 3-a) above.

4-You want to replace the stock firmware:
	download Alt-F-<version>.bin and use the Alt-F firmware upgrade web page to
	flash it. You can't flash Alt-F with the vendor firmware. This is deliberate.
	Alt-F firmware upgrade web page can flash the vendor supplied firmware, so
	you can always do a "downgrade". DLink 1.07 and 1.08, as well as Conceptronic
	1.05b5 firmware was flashed this way *** ON A REV-B1 BOARD ***
	OF COURSE THIS IS DANGEROUS, AND CAN TURN YOUR BOX INTO AN EXPENSIVE BLACK
	BRICK IN YOUR DESKTOP. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

By default, when booting, the DNS-323 will search for a file named fun_plug in the
hard disk users directory, usually Volume_1; if it finds it and the file has
the executable attribute set, it will be executed. Thanks D-Link!

When executed (read the fun_plug file, its readable, but DON'T CHANGE OR SAVE IT),
the Alt-F fun_plug script will look for a file named Alt-F-<version>.tar and will
extract it to a directory named alt-f; it will then try to terminate all running 
processes, unmount (or set as read-only) all filesystems, and load and run a new
kernel and filesystem image, the zImage and rootfs.arm.cpio-sq.lzma files).
That critical process is done using fonz "reloaded" kernel modules, read http://wiki.dns323.info/howto:ffp-reloaded
http://www.inreto.de/dns323/ or http://forum.dsmg600.info/viewforum.php?id=3
for more details.

So,after rebooting, the Alt-F-<version>.tar file will disappear and a new directory
name alt-f will appear.

If you want to uninstall Alt-F, just remove that directory and the fun_plug file.
If you have flashed Alt-F, you can revert the process by downloading a vendor firmware
image and flashing it using Alt-F firmware upgrade web page.

The reloaded*.ko modules are from fonz ffp-reloaded-0.5-2,
