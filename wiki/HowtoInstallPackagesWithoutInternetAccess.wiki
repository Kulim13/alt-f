#summary How to install packages without internet access.

= Introduction =

In same situations the box has no internet connectivity, for whatever reason, but the user might want to install additional Alt-F disk-installable packages.

== How to do it ==

In those situations, one package can be installed without internet connectivity: just download ipkg_0.99.163_arm.ipk from
[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1555717/DNS-323/Alt-F/pkgs/unstable/ipkg_0.99.163_arm.ipk?dl Dropbox] and drop it in the box /tmp directory.

Alt-F Package Manager installs it, and after that you can setup in the Alt-F Package Manager a local network package feed.
This means that you have to download all packages files, as well as the Package file, from the above site, make them available through a local-network httpd server, and configure that local httpd server directory as the package feed.

By the way, I'm using www.dropbox.com as the packager feed. If you like it and want to increase the space of my free account, do it using this [https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTE1NTU3MTc5?src=global0 link]
